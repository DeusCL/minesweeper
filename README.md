# Minesweeper

## Project Description

This project is a recreation of the famous Minesweeper game implemented in Python using Pygame. The game aims to offer a similar experience to the original, preserving the design and "chording" mechanics.

## Project Status

The project is considered complete and functional. However, additional improvements and adjustments can be made in the future. Adding a menu bar to modify difficulty through options is still pending.
